# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Djembeleza

I am a web developer. My hobbies are coding and playing video games. I started coding with C++ but I am usually playing around with languages such as Python and JavaScript. I also know HTML and CSS enough so I can prototype my projects. 

I got into web development because most of the technology is accessible and also I had a desire to build my web applications.
